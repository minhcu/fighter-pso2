            <b>Website này là sản phẩm mà mình làm được thông qua tự học FrontEnd</b>
            <p>Mình là một người chơi FI/HU PSO2 GLOBAL, tuy nhiên mình không phải là các sentai - gosu thuần thục class này. Chính vì vậy mà guide này chỉ có thể giúp các bạn tiếp cận Class Fighter một cách từ căn bản -> trung bình.</p>

          <h2>Giới thiệu về class Fighter</h2>
          <p>
            Fighter là class cận chiến, solo boss cực kỳ xịn xò. Một là boss chết, hai là bạn chết.
            Còn sống là còn đánh, người chết là người chưa win, người bỏ cuộc là người thua. 
            Đặc biệt, Fighter 
          </p>
          <p>
            Fighter sử dụng ba loại weapon khác nhau: Double Saber - Twin Daggers - Knuckles. 
            Mỗi loại sẽ phục vụ cho những mục đích khác nhau tùy theo lối chơi và loại boss bạn gặp.
            Capable of wielding the Double Saber, Twin Daggers, or Knuckles,
            this class rewards those who play dangerously, aided by skills that
            grant additional damage when the Fighter is cornered, wounded, or afflicted. 
            Fighters can also change battle stances, with Brave Stance boosting damage done 
            while in front of the target, while Wise stance increases damage inflicted from 
            behind the target.
          </p>
          <p>
              Fighter is not available in the initial character creator screen. 
              Please choose any class and complete the tutorial, 
              then visit Class Consultant Bhea in the Gate Area of the ARKS Ship to switch to this class.

          <h2>Vũ khí</h2>
          <h3>
            test
          </h3>
          <h3>Twin Daggers</h3>
          <p>Short-range daggers that excel at aerial combat. Capable of extremely fast attacks with multiple hits, and multiple PAs that allow maneuvering in all directions, both horizontally and vertically. Twin Dagger attacks and PAs also have very brief frontal Perfect Guard frames, allowing continuous offensive play if timed right. However, because PAs are so fast, it tends to also consume PP much faster than most other weapons. Twin Daggers can be powered up with the Skill Twin Daggers Focus, which grants them a damage bonus for staying airborne and performing multiple midair "jumps".</p>
          <p>Twin Daggers' Weapon Action is Spin. Pressing the Weapon Action button will cause the player to spin in the air. This counts as a jump for Twin Daggers Focus, deals minor damage at point-blank range, and blocks attacks with Perfect Guard frames.</p>
          <h3>Knuckle</h3>
          <p>A twin pair of weaponized gauntlets. Knuckles possess notoriously short range, but exceed even Swords in power to compensate. Their Photon Arts can hit extremely hard if given the opportunity, and are a powerful weapon when engaging a target one-on-one. Knuckles can be powered up with the Skill Knuckles Focus, which grants its user a power boost as long as the user continues a combo.</p>
          <p>Knuckles' Weapon Action is Sway. Pressing the Weapon Action button will cause the wielder to swiftly duck in place. This gives brief invulnerability and does not break combos for the purpose of Tech Arts and Knuckles Gear.</p>
          <h3>Double Saber</h3>
          <p>Short-range bladed weapons that are capable of dishing out a multitude of hits in a single combo. Double Saber PAs generally have multiple hits (but slower than Twin Daggers), and are capable of drawing enemies nearby with area of effect attacks. Focus management is a very important part of using Double Sabers. Double Sabers can be powered up with the Skill Double Saber Focus to execute their Weapon Action.</p>
          <p>Double Saber's Weapon Action is Whirlwind. When activated with the Weapon Action button, the wielder flourishes the weapon in the air. When used in tandem with Double Saber Focus, using it while at least one Focus Level is stocked will deplete your Focus Gauge and summon a whirlwind around you that deals repeated damage to enemies close to you. This whirlwind can be stacked up to two times. The more Focus is consumed upon activation, the more damage the whirlwind deals and the longer the duration.</p>
